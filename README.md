# Project Overview

As a Full-stack web developer, my responsibility for this project has been the creation and maintenance of the company's website. It incorporates a system for users to upload their documents and/or images which are then sent by email to the client. The back-end and front-end parts of this system are discussed in more detail below.

# Back-end
The back-end of the system was implemented using Java 11 and Spring Boot, a robust framework that simplifies the setup of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It makes use of Docker for application containerization, enabling consistent behavior across different environments.

The system also employs Gradle for managing project dependencies and Spring Boot Mail API for managing emails. The overall architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, which promotes the separation of concerns and makes the system more understandable and maintainable.

The deployment of the system is done in the cloud, ensuring high availability and scalability.

Technologies used include:

# Front-end
The front-end of the system was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload documents and/or images that are sent to the client by email.

Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, was used to ensure a responsive and attractive user interface that provides an excellent user experience on devices of all sizes.

# Usage
